        content: `Flyers are one of the most effective ways to reach people offline especially those not active on social media.
But printing and distributing them requires caution.

✅ Avoid using printers that log your activity (e.g. copy centers with ID)
✅ Use gloves if distributing in sensitive areas
✅ Avoid putting them on private property
✅ Use vague language if necessary — let QR codes do the rest
✅ Distribute during early hours or in groups to stay safe

This tactic works best when paired with high-foot-traffic zones like bus stops, campuses, or bakeries.`

        title: 'How to Use Secure Messaging Apps',
        content: `Not all messaging apps are created equal and many popular ones leak metadata.

✅ Use Signal or Session for direct communication
✅ Enable disappearing messages by default
✅ Avoid linking your phone number when possible
✅ Never send organizing details over unencrypted channels
✅ Turn off cloud backups for secure chats

Don’t use WhatsApp or Telegram for sensitive organizing. Even if encrypted, they store too much metadata.`

        title: 'Masking Your Identity in Public Actions',
        content: `If you're attending a protest or distributing material, take steps to protect your identity.

✅ Cover identifiable features: face, tattoos, hair
✅ Wear non-distinctive clothing (avoid logos or unique styles)
✅ Turn off biometric unlocks (Face ID, fingerprint)
✅ Don’t bring phones unless using airplane mode and no SIM
✅ Move in pairs or groups, not solo

The goal is to blend in, not stand out. Avoid attention before, during, and after.`

        id: 'documenting-rights',
        title: 'How to Film Police Without Getting Targeted',
        content: `Documenting police behavior can save lives but it also puts a target on you.

✅ Hold your phone low and horizontal
✅ Use apps that stream directly to the cloud
✅ Avoid shouting or standing too close to police
✅ Film from behind others or vehicles when possible
✅ Share footage only when safe — and never alone

If approached, stay calm and know your local laws. You're a witness, not a threat.`
